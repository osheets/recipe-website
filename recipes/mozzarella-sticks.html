        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>These mozzarella sticks with egg roll wrappers are amazing â€” better than any restaurant's, in my opinion.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 large Eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups Milk</li>
            <li>1.5 cups Italian seasoned Bread Crumbs</li>
            <li>10 egg roll wrappers</li>
            <li>10 Mozzarella String Cheese Sticks</li>
            <li>1 quart Vegetable Oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat eggs in a mixing bowl. Whisk in milk, then set aside.</li>
            <li>Place bread crumbs into a resealable plastic bag; set aside.</li>
            <li>Separate and lay an egg roll wrapper onto a flat, clean work surface with one of the tips pointed towards you. Moisten the two far edges of the wrapper with water. Place a string cheese stick onto the corner nearest you, then roll it in 1/3 of the way. Fold over the right and left corners, then continue rolling to the end, pressing to seal. Repeat this step with remaining string cheese sticks and egg roll wrappers.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Dip mozzarella sticks into egg mixture, then toss in bread crumbs.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry breaded mozzarella sticks in hot oil until crisp and golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
